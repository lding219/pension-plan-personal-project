# pension-plan-personal-project
The project is going to answer the following research question: How did pandemic and financial crisis affect the U.S. public pension plans, and what if the pandemic scale differs?
The data used for this report is from the new Public Plans Database (PPD) constructed by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the U.S. Census Bureau, the NCSL, and the Current Population Survey (CPS).
